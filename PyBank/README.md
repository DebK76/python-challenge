# python-challenge

In this assignment, I am applying the concepts I've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll (a real-world situation).
I started by creating a new repository for this project called python-challenge
Cloning the new repository to my computer.
Inside my local Git repository, I created a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.
In each folder created, I add the following content:
A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. Ensuring that the script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An analysis folder that contains text file that has the results from the analysis.
Then Pushing these changes to GitHub.

In this Challenge, I am tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of PyBank. Using the financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
I wrote a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Lastly, printing the final script for the analysis to the terminal and exporting it as a text file with the results.
