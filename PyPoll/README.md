# python-challenge

In this assignment, I am applying the concepts I've learned to complete two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll (a real-world situation).
I started by creating a new repository for this project called python-challenge
Cloning the new repository to my computer.
Inside my local Git repository, I created a folder for each Python assignment and name them PyBank and PyPoll.
In each folder created, I add the following content:
A new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder that contains the CSV files used. Ensuring that the script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An analysis folder that contains text file that has the results from the analysis.
Then Pushing these changes to GitHub.

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
The data set used for the poll data is called election_data.csv. It is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 
I will create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Lastly, printing the final script for the analysis to the terminal and exporting it as a text file with the results.

Note: This was a pretty difficult challenge for a beginner like myself. I received help from my peers on this assignment, and sourced and used codes I did not author or create from forum such as Stack Overflow, lectures powerpoint, Google, and Chatgpt
